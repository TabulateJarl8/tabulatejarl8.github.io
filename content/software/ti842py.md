ti842py is a TI-BASIC to Python 3 transpiler.

A transpiler is a piece of software that can convert code from one language to another. This program should be able to convert a lot of programs, but if you find something that it can't convert yet, start an issue. This transpiler also has the ability to automatically decompile any 8Xp file that you supply as the input file, with the help of my other project that I contribute to, basically-ti-basic. Note that this software is in beta and may produce inaccurate results.
