If you ask anyone who uses Linux what they think the best option for beginners is, you'll get a different answer from most everybody. That's what is great about Linux, is the freedom of choice. My first distribution was Manjaro, and then shortly after that I moved to Arch. Ever since switching to Arch, I can't seem to stick to anything else. The AUR, the speed of pacman, the rolling release architecture, and the potential for minimalism and customizability are my favorite parts, and I don't think there's any other distribution that quite matches Arch in these regards. However, I don't think I'd ever recommend Arch to new users due to the complexity and maintenance that is added from things like rolling release and the AUR. There are many, many options out there, so what _do_ I now recommend to new users?
