				<p>
					Hey, I'm Connor Sample. I started programming around 2014, and I know
					a wide variety of programming languages. I'm most proficient in Rust
					and Python, but I have ranging levels of experience using many
					languages from JavaScript to Bash to C to Java, and I pick up new
					languages fairly quickly. I'm an avid Linux user and I have skills in
					managing both desktop and server environments. I'm currently a student
					at James Madison University pursuing a degree in Computer Science with
					a minor in Music. After I graduate, I'd like to get a job in something
					I'm interested in, such as OS/systems development, networking, backend
					development, sysadmin, or something similar. Other than technology, I
					also really love music. I'm mainly a percussionist, but I also play
					guitar and tuba. I've been playing music since 2015 and I've played in
					a variety of ensembles, from high school wind ensemble and marching
					band to the MRDs at JMU.
